# Readme
Client can send a name as a parameter to the main function, and the server will verify(with the merkle tree proof) if the name is in the list


## Client

You can run the client from the top-level directory with `node client/index`. This file is a script which will send an HTTP request to the server.

Think of the client as the _prover_ here. It needs to prove to the server that some `name` is in the `MERKLE_ROOT` on the server. 

## Server

You can run the server from the top-level directory with `node server/index`. This file is an express server which will be hosted on port 1225 and respond to the client's request.

Think of the server as the _verifier_ here. It needs to verify that the `name` passed by the client is in the `MERKLE_ROOT`. If it is, then we can send the gift! 

## Utils

There are a few files in utils:

- The `MerkleTree.js` should look familiar from the Merkle Tree module! This one has been modified so you should not have to deal with any crypto type conversion. You can import this in your client/server
- The `verifyProof.js` should also look familiar. This was the last stage in the module. You can use this function to prove a name is in the merkle root, as show in the example.
